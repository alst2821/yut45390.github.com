=============
rst2html blog
=============

I discovered that rst2html is part of docutils and it is independent
of Sphinx.

Sphinx seems to be great to create documentation.

I only want to create a blog with entries and links.

Maybe I could include the odd image.

And text boxes.

Now, I am typing this on a normal editor and I have to discover how
the links and text boxes and images get to be included.

Now is when the docutils documentation should be very helpful.

The link to the docutils documentation is a link away from the
project's web page at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
