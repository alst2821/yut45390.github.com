When using a terminal from the 'Terminal' app on a Mac, I noticed
quickly that the meta key used in emacs and readline at linux
terminals does not operate as expected.

The solution is a checkbox labelled 'Use option as meta key'.

This is available from the app preferences menu, in the keyboard tab.

A `nice description with screenshots in osxdaily

taught me that. Thanks!
