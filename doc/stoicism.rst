==========
 Stoicism
==========

I created this section after reading "How to be a Stoic" by Massimo
Pigliucci (Penguin, London 2017).

The section on exercises (chapter 14) lists these:

1. Examine your impressions

2. Remind yourself of the impermanence of things

3. The reserve clause

4. How can I use virtue here and now

5. Pause and take a deep breath

6. Other-ize

7. Speak little and well

8. Choose your company well

9.  Respond to insults with humour

10. Don't speak too much about yourself

11. Speak without judging

12. Reflect on your day
