Gresham College Lecture by Nick Lane (20 May 2019)
`Energy and Matter at the Origin of Life <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEZJdK5hhvo>`_

References from slide of ATP (3'57): *Rich, P.* Nature **421**:583 (2003)

Methanogenesis
--------------

CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H20

40 times the mass ox excretion products as mass of cell.

*Life is a SIDE REACTION of a main exothermic reaction*

Slide at 6'53''

Stanley Miller experiment from 1953.  Flasks with methane, ammonia and
hydrogen. Electrical discharges produced a series of aminoacids.
'Bigger deal' than Crick and Watson's DNA publication, also from 1953.

Slide at 7'33''
Primordial soup: no evidence of it existed; nothing to contain the
reactants; high entropy; no thermodynamic driving force.

Slide at 10'22''
Günther Wächtershäuser: criticism against the primordial soup.

Slide at 11'29''
Black Smokers. Discovered in 1978

Problem with black smokers: The energy depends on the reaction of H2S
or H2 with O2. O2 comes from photosynthesis, that is, from the sun.

Cyanosulfidic protometabolism

Cyanide
Cyanoacetylene
Formamide
UV radiation
Zn sulphide
Wet-dry cycles

Jim-Peaco National Park

John Sutherland? 'Frankenstein chemistry'

Christian de Duve - nobel prize winner (physiology)
Enzymes created by selection.
Geochemistry becomes biochemistry.
The same pathways.

Mitochondrial ATP synthase. Sir John Walker.
