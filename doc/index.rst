Welcome to yut's documentation!
===============================

This is a documentation static site generated using `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

I talk a little bit about :ref:`python <ref-python>` and
:ref:`re-structured text <ref-docutils>`.

I also keep documentation about :ref:`Fedora <ref-fedora>` and other linux material.
This was originally in `other linux`_ page.

.. _`other linux`: https://sites.google.com/site/thelinux2017/

I use emacs as an editor and I created a page with some :ref:`notes <ref-emacs>` too.

I used to host a set of bookmarks in this site, but most of the
:ref:`bookmarks <ref-bookmarks>` are already unavailable, because they
are too old.
