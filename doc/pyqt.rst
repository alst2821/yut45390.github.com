 Python and Qt
===============

I just learned that Qt5 has two possible python bindings with
different licenses. `One article
<https://www.learnpyqt.com/blog/pyqt5-vs-pyside2/>`_ by Martin
Fitzpatrick at learnpyqt.com explains many things.

I like it already to write about it, even though I've so far read abot
60% down.

The alternatives are `PySide`_ by "the qt company" and `pyqt5`_ by Riverbank
Software.
