James Watson, `"The double helix"
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Double-Helix-James-Watson/dp/075382843X>`_
2010, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London.

This is a book I read circa 2015. It is an interesting story narrated
by Jim Watson, winner of the Nobel Prize. The parts of the story that
remain with me to capture in this summary are the urgency of getting
the work through. There was the competition of the great Pauli in the
U.S. who was quite certainly going to get through to the structure of
DNA before Watson and Crick. How the relationship with late Rosalind
Franklin was not the best for Watson. It seems that some chemists
thought that it was going to be them who would discover the structure
of DNA before Watson and Crick got to it.

"The plague"
by Albert Camus

"Enchiridion"
Epictetus
