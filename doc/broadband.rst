`Plusnet <https://www.plus.net/>`_ contract.  I signed for "plusnet
fibre" around March 2019. I paid on 13 March 2019. Line rental start
date is 28 March 2019 and it is on an 18-month contract.

The price was £197.88 for 12 months line rental. I think this was
"line rental saver".

From table 3 in the guide, for a low cost area, because I signed up
between 27th March 2018 and 6th August 2019 and have not changed the
broadband or fibre product:
