===========================
 A place of greater safety
===========================

This is a novel by Hilary Mantel from 1994. It is about the French
Revolution and follows many famous characters from their childhood to
around 1794, perhaps the peak of 'The Terror'. It ends with the
execution of the Dantonists.

Mantel lists hundreds of characters and tells many stories from
various points of view. The main characters are Danton and Desmoulins,
who become interesting and dear. Robespierre is also at the centre,
losing his lustre by the end.  Danton is shown as a humane
revolutionary with faults and vices.

In the introduction Mantel says that she would be interested in the
future to write about Marat. It's over 25 years and she has not, so it
may not happen. Instead we've been treated to novels about Thomas
Cromwell. Perhaps it's a good thing.
